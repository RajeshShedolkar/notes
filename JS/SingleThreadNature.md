single threaded nature of JS

what does "single thread in nature" mean?
A node program or process uses only single core to execute.
A single process will not utilize multiple cores to speed up the process by executing parts of the program.

JS can only use one of the thread at a time. This is why it is considered as BAD
language for scalable systems. But there is way to make use of all cores.
