An event loop in Node.js (or JavaScript) is like a manager that handles tasks (or events)   
that your program needs to do, one at a time, in an efficient and non-blocking way.

An event loop in JavaScript is a system that handles and manages the execution of tasks like user interactions, network requests, and timers. JavaScript is single-threaded, meaning it can only do one thing at a time. The event loop helps by continuously checking for tasks in a queue (like clicks, data from APIs, etc.) and runs them one by one, ensuring that everything gets processed in order without blocking other tasks. This allows JavaScript to handle multiple tasks asynchronously while still running on a single thread.
