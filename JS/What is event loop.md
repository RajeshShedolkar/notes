An event loop in Node.js (or JavaScript) is like a manager that handles tasks (or events) that your program needs to do, one at a time, in an efficient and non-blocking way.

Single-threaded: JavaScript can only do one thing at a time (it's single-threaded), so the event loop helps manage this by deciding what should be done next.
Tasks: When you ask JavaScript to do something, like read a file or make an API request, those tasks are sent to the event loop.
Non-blocking: The event loop doesn't wait for long tasks to finish. It keeps checking if there are smaller tasks it can handle while waiting for the longer ones.
Callback Queue: When the long tasks are finished (like after an API request gets a response), their callbacks (pieces of code) are added to a queue. The event loop checks this queue and processes the callbacks when it's ready.
Processing: The event loop continues to go back and forth between doing quick tasks and checking if any longer tasks are done, constantly managing what needs to be done next.
