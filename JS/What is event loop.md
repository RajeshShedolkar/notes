An event loop in Node.js (or JavaScript) is like a manager that handles tasks (or events) that your program needs to do, one at a time, in an efficient and non-blocking way.

Single-threaded: JavaScript can only do one thing at a time (it's single-threaded), so the event loop helps manage this by deciding what should be done next.
Tasks: When you ask JavaScript to do something, like read a file or make an API request, those tasks are sent to the event loop.
Non-blocking: The event loop doesn't wait for long tasks to finish. It keeps checking if there are smaller tasks it can handle while waiting for the longer ones.
Callback Queue: When the long tasks are finished (like after an API request gets a response), their callbacks (pieces of code) are added to a queue. The event loop checks this queue and processes the callbacks when it's ready.
Processing: The event loop continues to go back and forth between doing quick tasks and checking if any longer tasks are done, constantly managing what needs to be done next.

An event loop in JavaScript is a system that handles and manages the execution of tasks like user interactions, network requests, and timers. JavaScript is single-threaded, meaning it can only do one thing at a time. The event loop helps by continuously checking for tasks in a queue (like clicks, data from APIs, etc.) and runs them one by one, ensuring that everything gets processed in order without blocking other tasks. This allows JavaScript to handle multiple tasks asynchronously while still running on a single thread.  

Asynchronous Programming & Event Loop  
Non-blocking I/O: Core to Node.js; allows handling multiple requests without blocking the execution thread.  
Event Loop: Understand how the event loop manages asynchronous operations, including phases like timers, pending callbacks, and poll phases.  
Callbacks, Promises, and async/await: Essential tools for handling asynchronous code, with an understanding of their performance and error-handling implications.
