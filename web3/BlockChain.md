 Blockchain is the backbone of Web3.

The four key concepts of web3 ownership, decentralization, transparency and security.

These concepts go beyond mere abstract ideas.

They are based on a set of actual technologies that will make them possible.

At the core of Web3, technology is blockchain.

Blockchain provides the necessary infrastructure and protocols to give users unprecedented ownership and control over their digital assets.

Think of blockchain as a decentralized ledger(record book) that records and verifies transactions in a transparent and secure manner and why decentralization is key.

Let's see an example that will help us understand it.

The way the Internet works in Web2 is with a central authority as an intermediate.

The central authority could be Amazon, which owns the marketplace, that connects buyers and sellers.

It could be YouTube, which owns the platform that hosts videos from creators and serves them to users.

Or it could be PayPal, which handles financial transactions between people around the world.

The problem with this model is that the central authority has too much power.

YouTube can delete a user's account that accumulated thousands of subscribers over many years at any moment, and for arbitrary reasons.

Maybe they don't agree with the channel's political views.

PayPal could also block any transaction between users, again, for arbitrary reasons.

Not to mention that all users data is under the control of these companies and they could be used for purposes not interesting for the users.

In a decentralized network, there is no central authority and no arbitrary decisions either.

If John wants to send money to Sarah, there will be a decentralized network of independent nodes that

will verify the transaction.

For example, they will check if John has the funds.

If there is a consensus between the nodes, then the transaction will be executed.

This type of architecture provides many benefits to all users of the network.

All transactions are public and verifiable by anyone.

The transactions are also immutable.

So after being recorded in the blockchain, no transaction can be changed retroactively.

This helps establish trust among participants.

The immutability, combined with the use of advanced cryptographic techniques, makes the network tamper proof and secure.
