In programming, when reading files, encoding like UTF-8 specifies how the data in the file is represented as a sequence of bytes. Files can contain text in various languages and symbols, and encoding defines how that text is converted to binary data and how it can be interpreted back into readable text.

Here's what happens when you read a file with encoding (like UTF-8):
File Content Representation: The content of a file is stored as bytes (numbers), but we need to know how to interpret these bytes as characters. Encoding tells the program how to do that.
For example, in UTF-8, the character 'A' is stored as a single byte (65), but more complex characters (like Ã©) may take up 2 or more bytes.
Decoding Process: When you read the file using a specific encoding, your programming language will convert those bytes into readable characters based on the encoding scheme.
If the file contains text encoded in UTF-8, it reads and decodes it into Unicode characters.

```
# Open and read the file using UTF-8 encoding
with open('example.txt', encoding='utf-8') as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)
```

In this example, encoding='utf-8' ensures that the file is correctly interpreted as UTF-8. This is important because different encodings represent characters differently, and using the wrong encoding can lead to errors or unreadable text.

Why is Encoding Important?
Correct Text Representation: Without specifying the correct encoding, you might misinterpret characters in the file. For example, reading a UTF-8 file with ASCII encoding could result in garbled or missing characters.
Internationalization: UTF-8 is widely used because it can represent characters from many languages, supporting the full range of Unicode characters.
In general, UTF-8 is the most common encoding today because of its ability to represent a wide range of characters while maintaining backward compatibility with ASCII.
